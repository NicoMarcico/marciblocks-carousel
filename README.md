## Special notes

### Rendering in the editor

The carousel renders **WYSIWYG** in the editor, but without live navigation for performance reasons; As a result, only the first tab sees its data displayed (main image, caption, description) and the control and tab buttons don't work.

### Accessibility

A unique identifier per carousel, among those created in the post/page, is embedded in the container markup, so that each carousel has its own target used as an accessibility scope. You can add as many carousels as you like per post/page without compromising accessibility.

```HTML
<!-- carousel N¬∞1 -->
<section id="marciblocks-carousel-1"...>
    ...
    <!-- Main Images -->
    <div id="marciblocks-carousel-items-1"...>
        ...
    </div>
        <!-- Controls -->
        <div class="marciblocks-carousel-controls">
            <button aria-controls="marciblocks-carousel-items-1"...">
        ...

<!-- carousel N¬∞2 -->
<section id="marciblocks-carousel-2"...>
    ...
    <!-- Main Images -->
    <div id="marciblocks-carousel-items-2"...>
        ...
    </div>
        <!-- Controls -->
        <div class="marciblocks-carousel-controls">
            <button aria-controls="marciblocks-carousel-items-2"...">
        ...
```

In the back-end, a subscription is made to the block-editor store; An array of carousels present in the post/page is kept up to date, so is the props attribute carouselNumber using its index for identification. So that when, for example, the first carousel of the page is deleted, the second one becomes the first... This can be helpful for e.g. automatic numbering in text.
