## Installation

### Dev environment

This Gutenberg block plugin is built using `@wordpress/create-block` toolkit; It involves notably NPM and WebPack, so in order to run the development mode, ensure you have Node.js installed. I personaly use Yarn as a package manager but you can use npm as well, of course.

In the project root you can then run :

- `yarn install` **FIRST** to install dependencies (it will create *node_modules* folder)
- `yarn start` to start watching files and compiling **JS** ones and transpiling **SCSS** ones
- `yarn build` to prepare the *build* folder files for deployment (minification and so on)

Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰

## Special notes

### Rendering in the editor

The carousel renders WYSIWYG in the editor, but without live navigation for performance reasons; As a result, only the first tab sees its data displayed (main image, caption, description) and the control and tab buttons don't work.

### Accessibility

A unique identifier per article/page is embedded in the carousel container markup so you can add as many carousels as you like; each carousel has its own target used as an accessibility scope.

```HTML
<!-- carousel NÂ°1 -->
<section id="marciblocks-carousel-1"...>
    ...
    <!-- Main Images -->
    <div id="marciblocks-carousel-items-1"...>
        ...
    </div>
        <!-- Controls -->
        <div class="marciblocks-carousel-controls">
            <button aria-controls="marciblocks-carousel-items-1"...">
        ...

<!-- carousel NÂ°2 -->
<section id="marciblocks-carousel-2"...>
    ...
    <!-- Main Images -->
    <div id="marciblocks-carousel-items-2"...>
        ...
    </div>
        <!-- Controls -->
        <div class="marciblocks-carousel-controls">
            <button aria-controls="marciblocks-carousel-items-2"...">
        ...
```

In the back-end, a subscription is made and an array of carousels present in the post/page is kept up to date, so that when, for example, the first carousel of the page is deleted, the second one becomes the first... This can be helpful for e.g. automatic numbering in titles.
